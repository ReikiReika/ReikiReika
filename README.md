### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting my feet at GitHub
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning basic coding in C Program
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on all kinds of projects
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with... anything

I am very new to computers and coding.
Currently I'm interested in exploring the possibilities in Computer Science that piques my interest, contributing and learning through Github is one of them. 
Some that catches my eyes are Data Analysis, Software Engineering, VR/AR, Computer Graphics and Shaders, or just be a developer.
